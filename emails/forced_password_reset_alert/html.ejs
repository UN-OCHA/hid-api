<p>Dear <%= user.name %>,</p>

<p>Following UN regulations, as a security measure passwords must be changed every six months. We would like to remind you that your Humanitarian ID password is about to expire in 30 days. Please be informed that once the password expires you will not be able to access the <a href="https://humanitarian.id">Humanitarian ID</a> website and any of the <a href="https://about.humanitarian.id/partners-using-our-authentication-service">partner platforms</a>.</p>

<p>To change your password, simply click on the following link: <a href="https://auth.humanitarian.id/password">https://auth.humanitarian.id/password</a></p>

<p>You can also change your password from your profile in the Humanitarian ID website.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>
