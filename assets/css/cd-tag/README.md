# Tag

## Purpose and Usage
Provides visual indication of tags or other taxonomy present on an entity.

- title
- color (optional)

## Caveats
Since tags are Content within Drupal, a theme wishing to use this component will very likely have to implement their own rules to match their business logic. We can't provide all possible colors in advance.

### Variants

```
.cd-tag--rounded
.cd-tag--linked
```
