# Common Design: other

These don't belong to the CD Header/Footer and they aren't fundamental resets, but they all come in handy when set up from the beginning.

- **Skip link**: a link that follows the opening `<body>` tag allowing keyboard-navigating and/or non-visual users to skip directly to the page content.
- **Print styles**: CD websites have sensible settings when printed directly from the browser.
- **Icon reset**: some broad styles to apply to all icons on the site
- **Layout**: A collection of styles that enforce page layout in various ways. Some are for the global layout of Header/Footer, some are utility classes to provide consistent container behavior, and others are providing multi-column layout logic.
